**We need to know!**

Have an idea for a workshop that doesn't exist, that you just *know* in your gut could help you, or the global team sell a particular product more effectively?

We want to hear **all** of your feedback - the good *and* the bad, so please don't be shy. If you hold onto that feedback, it hurts our ability to delivery quality content. Your input is an absolutely critical component to the design process for existing and future content. We need to constantly hear from you - our sellers - as to what is, and what isn't relevant.
