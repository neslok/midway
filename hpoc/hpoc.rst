Basic HOWTO with a couple screenshots on creating a reservation

Need to knows:
  - Can only create for 48 hours without POC record in SFDC (reference Confluence page with SFDC POC instructions)
  - Making sure to select not the latest AOS/AHV
  - Selecting 3 out of 4 nodes for cluster
  - Do NOT select built in image/PC staging options

Notes on access options for customers - VPN/Frame/FTP - caution about putting customer data in HPOC environment
