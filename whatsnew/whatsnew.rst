What's New
----------

The SE POC Guide is a live document and is frequently updated to reflect changes in product positioning, tips and tricks, and most importantly accurate hands-on exercises.

Frequent Nutanix product updates mean that steps in these guides may not always 100% reflect your environment. For reference, we've provided the most recent product versions used to create this guide. Using older or newer versions may result in inconsistency.

This guide externally links to product documentation, and specific sections within product documentation, that may be version dependent. As a general rule, you should always consult the documentation relevant to the product version you are running.

*And critically, do NOT use the most bleeding edge version of a product release for a customer-facing POC UNTIL you have tested the features/functions included in your test plan and validated the environment works as expected.*
